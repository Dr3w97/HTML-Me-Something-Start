         <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Possibly the thing I'm most excited for out of all of them. Things have been moving so fast this few years and I couldnt be more thankful. I've had some hurdles to overcome during this time, but each and every one of them was solved in the best way possible. Pushing me forward in ways I never could've imagined. The path that life takes you on is rarely where you expect to go and is normally a lot bumpier too, but the downs in life make you cherish the ups even more. This little girl, my wife, and my son are the rocks that hold me in place and push me to be the best I can possibly be. Without them who knows where I would be but I know I'm far better for having them by my side.</p>
         
         <h3 class = "sectionTitle" id="armyHead">Leaving the Army</h3>
         <image src="images/Army Pic.JPG" width = 550></image>
         <p class="funParagraph">In the time I've served I've been all over the place. From Gorgia to South Korea to Maryland and now Pennsylvania. My time over seas was a blast that could've never happend without the Army. I learned so much about other cultures, made tons of new friends, and even met my wife. My time in the Army has been a wild one. It's made me want to kick and scream but on the other hand there's been times that have made me laugh until my sides hurt. I'm extremly happy to be putting this chapter of my life behind me but i will always be very thankful for everything it has provided me.</p>
         
         <h3 class = "sectionTitle" id="careerHead">Entering a new career field</h3>
         <image src="images/programming.jpeg" width = 550></image>
         <p class="funParagraph">Programming in the short time that I've been doing it has made me feel like I've finally found a home in what I want to do. I can't say I've ever felt like I could see myself doing anything for the rest of my life. Throughout the time I have been in this course and even before when I was working on a game as a little side project to get me ready for what was to come I feel like I have found something I could love for years to come. I love learning new things and seeing them come together in practice. It is beyond rewarding and I'm excited to see what I can do with it moving forward.</p>
         
         <h3 class = "sectionTitle" id="marrigeHead">Getting Married!</h3>
         <image src="images/my family.jpg" width = 550></image>
         <p class="funParagraph">We're already married but we never had our ceremony so it's something to look forward to none the less. This woman in a short time has etched her name into my heart forever. It sounds so sappy but I can't help but gush when I talk about her. The family we are building pushes me to be greater day by day and is my biggest motivator. Since she came into my life i have had nothing but good things to look forward to. From the average lazy day, to adventures on the beach, to walks around our neighborhood, things are always exciting. Life has been a wild ride since we met and things continue to get better.</p>
